BY JERICHO BROWN
A poem is a gesture toward home.
It makes dark demands I call my own.

                Memory makes demands darker than my own:
                My last love drove a burgundy car. 

My first love drove a burgundy car. 
He was fast and awful, tall as my father.

                Steadfast and awful, my tall father
                Hit hard as a hailstorm. He'd leave marks. 

Light rain hits easy but leaves its own mark
Like the sound of a mother weeping again.

                Like the sound of my mother weeping again,
                No sound beating ends where it began. 

None of the beaten end up how we began. 
A poem is a gesture toward home.
